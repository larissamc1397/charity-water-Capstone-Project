    Since charity: water was founded in 2006, we’ve been chasing one ambitious goal: ending the global water crisis. And while the water crisis is huge, we’re optimistic. We know how to solve the problem, and we make progress every day thanks to the help of local partners and generous supporters. If we work together, we believe everyone will have access to life’s most basic need within our lifetime.

    <h3>Women empowerement</h3>
    <p>
        Women and girls are responsible for water collection in 8 out of 10 households with water off premises.5
        <br>
        When a community gets water, women and girls get their lives back. They start businesses, improve their homes, and take charge of their own futures.   
    </p>

    <img class="time" src="Images/Coming Soon.jpg" alt="insert imager here">
    <h3>Time</h3>
    <p>
        Every day, women and girls around the world spend an estimated 200 million hours collecting water.
        <br>
         Access to clean water gives communities more time to grow food, earn an income, and go to school -- all of which fight poverty.   
    </p>

    <img class="education" src="Images/Coming Soon.jpg" alt="insert imager here">
    <h3>Education</h3>
    <p>
        Clean water helps keep kids in school, especially girls.
        <br>
        Less time collecting water means more time in class. Clean water and proper toilets at school means teenage girls don’t have to stay home for a week out of every month.   
    </p>

    <img class="health" src="Images/Coming Soon.jpg" alt="insert imager here">
    <h3>Health</h3>
    <p>
        Diseases from dirty water kill more people every year than all forms of violence, including war. 
        <br> 
        Children under-five are on average more than 20 times more likely to die from illnesses linked to unsafe water and bad sanitation than from conflict.
